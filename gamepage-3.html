                        <p>My project is a reel of technical arts to show the workflow of how introducing Houdini into indie game projects or game projects by small groups.</p>
                        <p><b>Research summary:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Game artists in China usually have little development background, they feel hard to work on codes or tools required logic-thinking. They prefer tools that what you see is what you get. For example, they usually prefer to read and create map than adjusting parameters.
                            </li>
                            <li>For some designers lack of budget to make their games, they will be twice as busy as others.
                            </li>
                            <li>The project files need to be well organised.
                            </li>
                            <li>The final game graphic should be as good as possible.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Target Audience:</b></p>
                        <p>Indie game artists (or artists in small game companies) who have a desire to make video games.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>My Goals:</b></p>
                        <p>Help artists quickly create realistic nature scenes.</p>
                        <p><b>Concepts:</b></p>
                        <p>There will be a series of packages made by procedural tools, and then exported  into Unity, for each step of game art works. 
                        <br> People who is familiar to those tools can go to the original files and quickly modify them to create a nature scene,  or they can stay in Unity and make slightly modification to build a nature scene.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Design Precedents:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Games such as Assassin's Creed Odyssey, although this is not an indie game, this game was published 3 years ago, we can learn a lot about what could be in a video game, and what's the level of graphics we can achieve too.</li>

                                    Lowpoly group to generate low polygon, a slider to control how many polygons will be generated for the final 3d model.

                            The Auto UV tool:
                            Although the Game development toolset already have good auto UV tool, it still not perfect for my stones, because I hope those UV seems can be hided well. I'm trying to create my own UV tool, but it still have many bugs in this week.

                        <p><b>Problems Solved: </b></p>   
                        <ul><li>The Auto UV tool: Although I can't design a very polished auto UV tool without any distortion and has very smoothly seems. I designed a toggle for users to select my auto UV tool which can hide the seems but more distortions or the <a href="https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/houdini-game-dev-tools-auto-uvs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameDev Auto UV</a> which will have flatter UVs with less distortion.</li>
                        <li>
                            The Whole Generator in Unity: The rock generator won't have the Unity tool, because the process of generating high polygons and rendering them must limit the performance in Unity. We can just create 3d models here and export them to Unity.
                        </li></ul>
                        <p><b>Rock Texture Generator:</b></p>
                        <ul><li>The Texture Generator was made in Substance Designer, a procedural textures software. It was designed as 2 part, the basic one is a node to create textures, which requires rendered textures, such as Normal map, input and then output textures for Unity.</li>
                        <li>Users who are experts of Substance Designer could modify parameters to have many styles of stones. Also there are 3 preset styles of rocks for beginners.</li></ul>
                        <p><b>Memo:</b></p>
                        <ul>Hope there could be mosses added to rocks, and they could be adjusted from less to more.</ul>

                        <p><b>Goals: </b></p>
                        <ul><li>Multi-layer branches
                            <ul>Each layer of branches could be adjusted by parameters, I can design a set of branch nodes and reuse them for each layer.</ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Reuseable textures for certain styles of trees
                            <ul>UVs need to be considered during 3d stage, to reuse textures, its models should be super flat and the more like rectangles the better, which means 3d models should separate branches into different columns, so that their UVs could be perfect rectangles.</ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Link every random seed together in one slider, so that beginners can modify their trees by simply change it.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>How to Realize: </b></p>
                        <ol><li>Create lines for the shape of trunk and branches.
                            <ul><li>We can control how much noises added to their points and how smooth they will be.</li></ul>
                        </li>
                            <li>"Sweep" or "Extrude" node can generate column basic on lines.
                                <ul><li>I use "Extrude" at the beginning, but this node require us to project UV from empty, not convenient enough, and will cause many other issuses.</li>
                                    <li>"Sweep" node has build-in curves to control the radius of the column. We can control each layer of branches' shape here.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Select points from upper layer's lines as root points of sub-layer branches.
                                <ul><li>Store the radius at certain point's position from upper layer's branch as a variable of each point. Then transfer them to sub-layer branches, so that they will have a basic radius.</li>
                                <li>There are loops to roughly create new branch for each point and they are simply interspersed. For the goal of reusing textures, abandon smooth connections between upper-layer and sub-layer branches can create better UVs which can be projected as perfect rectagles with less distortions.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Reuse these process above for multiple times for each branch layer. Considered about the polygons amount, I designed a trunk and 4 layers of branches.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <li>For each leaf, it will be render in transparent shaders in Unity, so I can just random generate simple grids on branches ,the columns and rows are from 2x2 to 4x4.</li>
                    <li>By calculating their point numbers, I can pick the points of leaf veins to bend them to reduce the chance that the grids will disappear when viewed from the side, because they have no thickness.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>UV projection and layout: </b></p>
                    <ul><li>To reuse textures, I have to abandon some textures such as Ambient Occlusion Maps, Curvatures or Position maps, each layer of branches only ocupied a rectangle in the layout, and most of them are overlapped together. This will lead to a worse quality of final textures, but it will highly reuse UV maps.</li>
                    <li>All of the rectagles of branches are vertical, so that we can make a vertical texture for tree barks.</li>
                    <li>The required inputs of the texture generator is just a normal map and a set of textures of the leaf</li>
                    <li>Texture Generator of trees has two ways to create textures. A flat and vertical real tree bark texture or changing colors of my texture generator. </li>
                    <li>For leaves, I gave up procedural textures, because I can quickly get textures as inputs from the <a href="https://www.textures.com/library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">textures.com</a> </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Need to do next: </b></p>
                    <ul><li>Renderer required, need to render every layer of branches separately in 3D, because too much pieces of UVs are overlapped, they don't have to render multiple times.</li></ul>

                    <ol><li>When first load these digital assets into Unity, it shows empty in Unity.
                            <ul>The empty tool is due to that the saved digital assets were covered by another one,sometimes there will be multiple definitions for one asset. Clean up the file which may target to the same definition, and reopen Unity will deal with this issue.</ul>
                            <ul>For some reasons, if only show parts of parameters, I rebuilt a sub-network and a totally clean digital asset, and rebuilt parameters then link them again.</ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The original leaves are composed by 2 pieces of grids due to the the cull back in currently render. To reduce the polygons, remove one of two grids and terning to double side render.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><b>Terrains:</b></p>
                    <ul><li>I selected the Unity Terrain tool to test the game scene with my generated assets, then I paint trees on terrain, it can support generated tree or shrub models by tools in Unity well.
                            But imported models from houdini are not supported well with Unity tree paint tool. Those models usually have too much children gameobjects, I cleaned up useless information in houdini to better the direct output 3d models. </li>
                        <li>I created a set of textures for grasses to test.</li>

                    <ol><li>The materials of trees or any other gameobjects with latest HDRP lit shader are incorrect in transparent order.</li>
                        <li>The Terrain in HDRP doesn't support detail shaders, I can't create grasses without huge waste of performance. 
                                <ul>I found 2 different solutions to try:
                                    <li>a groups of polygons, require polygons faced to different angles, at least 3 faces for each smallest group.</li>
                                    <li>a single face for each piece of grass but works with Billboard Shader (Polygons with this shader are always facing to the camera.) </li>

                            <ul>When I finish wind shader for grasses, I found the tree leaves need a wind shader too, unless they will look uncompatible.
                                Leaves and trunk will be pushed by wind both. I separate them to 2 parts in shader:
                                <li> leaves: I use SmoothStep calculation 2 times to control U and V separately as a mask of leaves to make sure that only leaves will be pushed, but by this way, it's better not to change the tree's UV set. Or at least, let the leaves UV always stay at the top right corner of UV map. 
                                </li> 
                                <li> trunk and branches: Because I reused most uv of branches, my grasses shader will make a lot of errors when pushing the trunk and branches. 
                                    I found another way to deal with this, I split the vertex position in object space, and get the X and Z values, value changes on X and Z axis will simulate a pushing force.

                        <p><b>Solutions:</b></p>
                        <p>To achieve the season changing feature by script, the script allows to add materials dynamically, while the script will changing the main color of each shader. I set the main color of all my shaders as "_color".</p>
                        <p>To show my season changing features for users, I add an input control of the space. Users can hold the space to see how season chaning during runtime.</p>
                        <p>To control color changine smoothly, I choose the function "Color.Lerp(Color a,Color b,float t)", and set up 4 colors for different season. Such as greenyellow, green, orange, and vermillion.</p>
                        <p>To achieve the bare trees, I modified my shaders with a new exposed channel (the alpha channel) of main color to control the clip range. For this channel, 1 means no extra clips for leaves, and 0 means clip the whole leaves.</p>
